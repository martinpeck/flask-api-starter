# Basic FlaskAPI App

This repository is a starting point for a FlaskAPI based web app.

## Setup

In order to run the application you'll need the following:

- Install `pipenv` (required)
- Install `pyenv` (optional)

This project uses `pipenv` to manage packages.

I would also recommend installing `pyenv` as this allows you to select a specific version of Python, and this project contains a `.python-version` file to auto-select a specific version.
